 # **PC_Parts Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
-  **Objective**:
             To develop a CNN-based model for classifying PC parts images into categories such as cables, case, CPU, GPU, RAM, etc.
  
- **Technologies and Tools** :
    Python
    TensorFlow
    CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)
    ImageDataGenerator: For Data augmentation techniques (such as rescale, rotation_range, flipping, scaling and range)
    Layers: such as Conv2D, MaxPool2D, Flatten, Dense
    GitHub for version control and collaboration
